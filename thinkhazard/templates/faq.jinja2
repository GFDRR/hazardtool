      What are the aims of this tool?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      <em>ThinkHazard!</em> is a simple tool that enables people to discover the level of hazard, for multiple hazards, in any location around the world. It aims to provide recommendations for actions that users can take to manage that hazard, and provide additional information relevant to the hazard and location. The tool draws on multiple data sources to provide the level of hazard, and is set-up to become increasingly comprehensive over time as users contribute new data and information

      What is the long term vision for the tool?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      The long-term vision for <em>ThinkHazard!</em> is that it becomes a place for users to explore and understand natural hazard levels around the world, and obtain guidance on how to consider natural hazards in their projects. <em>ThinkHazard!</em> will continue to be updated, and we encourage users of <em>ThinkHazard!</em> to provide feedback, hazard datasets that could improve it (especially at national, provincial and district levels), and additional resources (websites and publications) that can contribute to a growing repository of knowledge on this <em>ThinkHazard!</em> website. Our intention to continuously update the hazard data to reflect the latest knowledge in each hazard.

      Where can I get a more specific version for my type of projects?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      This initial version of <em>ThinkHazard!</em> is designed to be generic and not to provide specific recommendations for different sectors. Instead, we encourage partners who work in sectoral areas to work with us to produce sector (or project) specific versions of this tool, which would provide recommendations tailored to a specific type of project (for example, recommendations on school construction on a version of <em>ThinkHazard!</em> that is dedicated to the education sector). THe code is open-source, so the tool structure can be reproduced for different projects or purposes. If you see a need for a specific type of project, please get in touch using the feedback button, available on every page, to discuss development.

      How well do the results in <em>ThinkHazard!</em> align with expert opinion on the hazards in each country?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      The <em>ThinkHazard!</em> team commissioned independent analysis of how well <em>ThinkHazard!</em> estimated the hazard for up to 77 developing countries around the world and the results can be seen <a href="here" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7QVzSpnQtEnR21vRkUtUVRoVHM/view?usp=sharing</a>. We recognise the importance of producing accurate results for our users so we are constantly looking for more accurate national and local datasets to supplement the global datasets that are predominantly used in the tool. If you are aware of additional hazard datasets please contact us via the feedback button, available on every page.

      <dd>
      We encourage all owners and developers of hazard data to share those data for use in <em>ThinkHazard!</em>. If the dataset that you provide is used in the analysis of hazard in a project area, your institution will be credited as the data source with a weblink provided directly to your institution. Please use the user feedback form to let us know what datasets you would be able to contribute, and we’ll get in touch directly to discuss further.

      The hazard data seems to contradict other data I have seen or used. Why is this?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      <em>ThinkHazard!</em> uses a variety of sources of hazard data and the data source is provided on the map interface for each hazard. Some datasets are global and therefore are developed at a coarser resolution with a variety of assumptions. This may not be consistent with higher resolution or more detailed data available at the national or local level. Where local data has been provided for use within <em>ThinkHazard!</em>, it will be shown. We encourage all users to provide their feedback on hazard data and to highlight where higher resolution or more detailed hazard data is available. Please use the feedback button, available on every page, to let us know, and we’ll get in touch to discuss further.

      How do you decide which hazard data to use for hazard levels?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      Where multiple hazard datasets are available for a single location and hazard, <em>ThinkHazard!</em> uses a decision tree to decide which dataset should be used. Submitted hazard data is reviewed by GFDRR hazard and risk specialists. A rating is assigned on the basis of age, methodology used, assumptions, and resolution of the data. Data with a higher rating is shown as a preference to users of <em>ThinkHazard!</em>.

      Is <em>ThinkHazard!</em> open-source?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      <em>ThinkHazard!</em> has been designed as open-source from the start, with the code for <em>ThinkHazard!</em> available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard" target="_blank">https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard</a>. Open-source technology means that partners can easily adapt <em>ThinkHazard!</em>  for their own use and to jointly contribute to the ongoing development of <em>ThinkHazard!</em> into the future.

      What hazard data are used in <em>ThinkHazard!</em>, and can I download it for use elsewhere?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      The data source used to produce the hazard levels is listed beneath the map, on the hazard specific recommendations page. By clicking on the data source name, you can download any data that are openly available. All data are stored on the Innovation Labs Geonode, at <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard" target="_blank">https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard</a>.Data with commercial limitations on sharing are not available to download.

      What do the hazard levels mean?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      Hazard level is calculated according the frequency, at which that hazard is expected to occur with a damaging level of intensity. For each hazard we have set an intensity threshold, above which the intensity parameter is considered to be able to cause damage to a development project of undefined type.

      Does ThinkHazard! provide the hazard level at my specific project location, or location of interest?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      ThinkHazard! provides the maximum hazard level within an administrative unit 1 or 2. It does not provide the hazard level at specific locations. This tool is a starting point to increase awareness of the hazards and levels of hazard present in an area; to determine the specific hazard level at a point or specific location, users should refer to a hazard map for the area. This is particularly important for hazards that can be very localized, and affect locations very differently, though they may only be short distances apart, for example, floods and landslides.

      <dt>
      Why does ThinkHazard! show water scarcity but not drought hazard?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      Water scarcity is a shortage of river runoff, in relation to the population density, and is available at multiple return periods as a global dataset. Drought data can also be shown in ThinkHazard!, provided they are available at multiple return periods. While there are many datasets providing drought indexes, these cannot be utilized in the present version of ThinkHazard!.

      How do you account for permanent water bodies in river flood hazard?
      </dt>
      <dd>
      ThinkHazard! uses river flood hazard data sets that include a 2-year and/or 5-year return period layer in its calculation of hazard level. One of these layers (2-year if available, otherwise 5-year) are used to exclude areas of permanent water from the calculation. If areas of permanent water were included in the calculation, almost all administrative areas would have High hazard. We use the return period layers in place of a global water body mask, because a global mask layer was found to not effectively exclude small rivers. This also resulted in almost all administrative areas being considered as High hazard.
